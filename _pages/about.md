I'm a first-year graduate student from the Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education, Central China Normal University. My research interests include machine learning, data mining, fine-tuning of large language models, and prompt engineering.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Zhang Wei from the Faculty of Artificial Intelligence in Education, Central China Normal University.
